# CLAUDE.md — kevinclark.ai Portfolio Site

## Behavior Instructions
- Never output full file rewrites unless explicitly asked
- Provide targeted edits: show only the changed lines with enough context to locate them
- When making multiple changes, list them as numbered steps with file paths and line references
- Prefer terminal commands for anything that can be done via CLI
- Flag any change that could break the build before making it
