# CLAUDE.md — kevinclark.ai Portfolio Site

## Behavior Instructions
- Never output full file rewrites unless explicitly asked
- Provide targeted edits: show only the changed lines with enough context to locate them
- When making multiple changes, list them as numbered steps with file paths and line references
- Prefer terminal commands for anything that can be done via CLI
- Flag any change that could break the build before making it

## SEO / Canonical
- `Layout.astro` uses `Astro.url.href` for both `<link rel="canonical">` and `og:url` (per-page, not hardcoded)
- `astro.config.mjs` has `site: 'https://kevinclark.ai'` — required for `Astro.url` to resolve to the real domain in static builds; do not remove

## Pending Work
- Copy edits throughout
- Writing section: fill with essays
- Mobile hamburger menu refinement
